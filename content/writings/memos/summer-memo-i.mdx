## Overview

Welcome to the first Executive Meeting of Summer 2025. This will not be a particularly long memo, as it stands more to be a call to work. Our goals for this summer are as follows:

1. Completely plan out every single Edge Lab meeting, including creation of weekly presentations and activities.

2. Plan and complete coordination of opening Fall semester events, i.e. Hello CS, S.O.L.E Fest, Fall Fest, Data Science Day.

3. Complete Budget Proposal and other financial duties.

4. Completely plan out and coordinate GBMâ€™s for semester, i.e. speaker events, etc....

5. Pin down format for TnT weekly meetings.

Overall, these are our goals for this summer. I am going to give generally more rope than I have in the past, meaning, I am going to really try to not micro-manage. What that means, though, is that it will be up to each and everyone of you to maintain your own pace of progress. We will still meet every week, primarily for status updates and the occasional brainstorming session, however, you will be working with your teammate to ensure the success of Edge Carolina this coming semester. I know we can all do it.

Stay hungry, Stay foolish.
